## Ktor Projects

- [Kryptokrona API](https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona-api) For caching and processing data from the blockchain to provide faster access for services.
- [Kodein](https://github.com/kosi-libs/Kodein) Kodein is a very simple and yet very useful dependency retrieval container. it is very easy to use and configure.
- [Ktor OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/papsign/Ktor-OpenAPI-Generator) Ktor OpenAPI/Swagger 3 Generator.
- [Ktor OpenAPI Spec Generator](https://github.com/bkbnio/kompendium) Intended to be a non-invasive OpenAPI spec generator for Ktor APIs. By operating entirely through Ktor's plugin architecture, it allows you to incrementally document your API without requiring you to rip out and replace the amazing code you have already written.
- [ktor-health-check](https://github.com/zensum/ktor-health-check) Simple, opinionated ktor health and readiness checks made for Kubernetes.
- [Cohort](https://github.com/sksamuel/cohort) Spring Actuator style replacement for Ktor. Provides health checks for orchestrators like Kubernetes and management of logging, databases, JVM settings, memory and threads in production.
- [SuspendApp with Ktor](https://github.com/arrow-kt/suspendapp#suspendapp-with-ktor) The module suspendapp-ktor provides a server constructor that lifts the Ktor ApplicationEngine in to a Resource, representing the Engine running an Application(i.e Netty) while supporting auto-reload.
- [kotlin-kafka](https://github.com/nomisRev/kotlin-kafka) Kafka bindings for Kotlin `suspend`, and Kafka streaming operators for KotlinX Flow. Designed for usage in Ktor.
- [Hoplite](https://github.com/sksamuel/hoplite) Kotlin library for loading configuration files into typesafe classes in a boilerplate-free way. Define your config using Kotlin data classes, and at startup Hoplite will read from one or more config files, mapping the values in those files into your config classes. Designed for usage in Ktor.
- [Tribune](https://github.com/sksamuel/tribune) Multiplatform Kotlin library that builds on Arrow to provide a toolset for creating simple parsers from raw input types, to properly validated parsed types. Designed for usage in Ktor.
